Things to improve:
1. Head of the snake could be a different symbol or color, to be easier recognized.
2. Number of X could be counted as score achieved. Makes it more interesting to play again.
3. Game ends when there is no more possible move.
4. impossible moves could be counted (when the position is already occupied or moving out of the map) and could be limited; 
    e.g. after 3-5 impossible moves/wrong tries, game ends.
